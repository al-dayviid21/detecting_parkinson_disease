## Installation
The necessary libraries to run the code here are found in requirements.txt. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
The use of data science in healthcare has the potential to improve services and outcomes, particularly when it comes to early detection of diseases. In this project, we will use Python to build a system for detecting Parkinson's Disease, a degenerative disorder of the nervous system that impacts movement and can cause tremors and stiffness. By using data science to identify this condition early on, we can potentially improve the prognosis for those affected.

## File Descriptions
There is 1 python notebook available here to showcase work related to the questions posed above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. The link to the dataset can be found <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/">here</a>. Additionally, the "requirements.txt" is available to depict the needed libraries.
